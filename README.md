In this Android assignment, you are required to develop an app of your own idea, considering the following guidelines:

Requirements:

1. The app should consist of a minimum of three user interface (UI) screens, allowing users to navigate between them.
2. Utilize rich Android widgets/components/adapters in your app's design.
3. Apply the techniques learned in class, such as threading, callback interfaces, and parsing JSON.
4. The app must retrieve data from a chosen web service and present it to the user.
5. Implement persistent storage using Room DB to store data locally.
6. Support both landscape and portrait orientations in your app.
7. Incorporate at least one resource qualifier, such as color, string, language, or dimensions, in your app's design.
8. A very basic API data implementation will only receive 50% of the total marks.
9. Follow the "Separation of Concern" design pattern by creating appropriate models/services for your project.

Submission:
1. Create a video demonstrating your app's implementation. The video should be no longer than 6 minutes. 
Make sure to close the app and restart it to showcase the persistent storage feature.

2. Push your app to a GitHub repository and submit the repository link through Blackboard. 
Without a valid GitHub link, you will receive a score of 0.

3. In a Word document, provide a brief explanation of your app idea and describe its main functionalities.
